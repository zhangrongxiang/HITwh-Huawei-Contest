# HITwh-Huawei-Contest
This is my code(**First Prize**)in the HUAWEI Programming Contest held in HITwh.  

The aim is to design a TO-DO list app using ArkTS which can be installed in the ```HarmonyOS. ``` 

```ArkTS``` is the preferred high-level programming language for application development in HarmonyOS. ArkTS provides capabilities such as declarative UI paradigm and status management, helping you develop applications in a simpler and more natural way.

While maintaining the basic syntax style of TypeScript, ArkTS further enhances static check and analysis. In this way, more errors can be detected during development, improving code robustness and achieving better running performance.
